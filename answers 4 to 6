No it is not correct 
correct way is 
ArrayList<Integer> arrlist=new ArrayList<Integer>();
& for Doubl   -   ArrayList<Double> aarlist=new Arraylist<Double>();

a. As the name suggests polymorphism is the function in many forms.
It can be compile-time or runtime. Compile time can be achieved by either method overloading or operator overloading,
whereas runtime polimorphism is achieved with the help of method overriding
b. Overloading is the process of changing the signature of functions i.e the parameters can be different in the methods having the same name.
c. Overriding is achieved with the help of inheritance where the method is base class is defined again with same attributes in the child class and perform differently as
comparred to the main class.

Multiple Inheritance is a feature of an object-oriented concept, where a class can inherit properties of more than one parent class. 
The problem occurs when there exist methods with the same signature in both the superclasses and subclass. 
On calling the method, the compiler cannot determine which class method to be called and even on calling which class method gets the priority. Thus,
to prevent ambiguity multiple inheritance is not supported in java.

7.
We can make a static class in java by adding the static keyword before class.
eg.- static class pangram{
...}
2nd question : How to make a normal class static in behaviour??
Ans - According to me , if we define every variables and methods in a non static class as static , then the class will work as a static class.
